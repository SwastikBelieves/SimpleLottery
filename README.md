# 🎯 Transparent Guessing Game using Smart Randomness

Welcome to the *Transparent Guessing Game, a beginner-friendly Solidity smart contract project built to demonstrate how **commit–reveal randomness* works in a decentralized and transparent way.  
This game ensures fairness — even the owner can’t cheat — and all players can verify every step on the blockchain.

## 🧩 Project Description

This project is a *simple blockchain-based guessing game* written in Solidity.  
The idea is to create a *transparent and trustless game* where:

- The owner commits to a secret number before anyone starts guessing.  
- Players place their guesses by sending a small amount of Ether.  
- Later, the owner *reveals* the secret, and those who guessed correctly *win the prize pool*.  

No centralized control, no hidden manipulations — everything is verifiable on-chain.

## 🚀 What It Does

1. *Owner commits a secret hash* (made from a secret number + random salt).  
2. *Players submit guesses* (numbers) along with their bets.  
3. After all guesses are in, the *owner reveals the secret*, proving it matches the earlier commitment.  
4. The smart contract *automatically determines winners* and allows them to claim their share of the prize.  
5. If the owner fails to reveal in time, *players can get refunds*.

All transactions are logged on the blockchain, providing full transparency.
